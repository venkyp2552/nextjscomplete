If we want to do Nested Rendering with in the Router we can use Nester files as simple as sthat which we have on the code like posts folder examples..
    -localhost:3000/ -->Home ROunte
    -/posts -->Post Routing....
    -.posts/newpost  --> New Post Rounting...

u2:
    -if we want to render parameter based or dynamic rendering wil follow below steps
    -in react we use like /posts/:postId
                          -/posts/blog-post-1
                          -/posts/blog-post-2
                          -/posts/blog-post-3 etcc....
    -But in NextJs will follw like below..
    -posts
        -[postId] have to create with in the square brackets only...
        which means [postId] this is the dynamic folder withing the posts...
        - with in the posts folder we can create a new layout.js file also.
            the purpose of this file is to allow us to sharing the UI Components between the Routes.
